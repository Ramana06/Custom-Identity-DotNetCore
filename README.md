# Custom / Extended Identity using .NET Core and ADO.NET

By default, the ASP.NET Core Identity system stores user information in a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core.

This project demonstrates how to create your own user and role store, giving you the power to retrieve and insert data via ado.net - rather than entity framework.
